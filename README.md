# Project Description
This Project is designed to make a word day scheduler, so that the user may use it to keep up on their day. Challenges that I faced are trying to create functions via jquery and correctly using the (this) element in the correct manner.

When you open the project you are presented with work day scheduler with time blocks that run from 9am to 5pm. The current day and hour is displayed at the top of the calendar. Based on the current time, the scheduler will represent three colors. Gray for past hours, red for the current hour, and green for any future hours still available. You can click on any time block and enter any event you want. once you hit the save button it will be saved into the local storage. If you for some reason refresh the page your saved events will still be on the scheduler.

# HTML File
Started with starter code. Placed the HTML file with semantic HTML tags to ensure a well-structed document. Inserted comments to breakdown the document further to make it easier to read.

# CSS File
Started with starter code to assist the HTML & Javascript files to have a expansive website. Inserted comments to breakdown the document further to make it easier to read, and to inform them of where the elements are being used.

# Javascript File
Started with starter code and comments. placed document.ready function at the head to ensure that the HTML file is ready before the javascript starts. By doing this we ensure a smooth operation from function to function to make the process of following the code easier. Created loop function for the keep saved data on the screen and to see if the block time was the same as the actual real world time. created click function for the save button to endure the events are saved into the local storage. Also inserted comments to breakdown the document further to make it easier to read.

# Github
Pushed out commits of the HTML, CSS, Javascript, and README when finishing any coding edits, as to ensure I could go back at anytime to earlier designs if need be.
